Changes in:

V 1.3.2 (Mar 21, 2009):
 1) Added vozisol, a version of voz* designed to work on an isolated
    bunch of points not in a periodic box.
 2) Some changes in zobovpostproc.py to work with current versions of
    python packages (matplotlib, numpy)
 3) Added a void-finding example illustrating vozisol and
    zobovpostproc.py to /examples, poisson_vloidsters.bash
 4) Incorporated the new qhull version 2010.1

V 1.3.1 (Apr 19, 2008):
 1) jozov.c edited to work for both voids and clusters.  
    Alpha version; not extensively tested.

V 1.3 (Feb 29, 2008):
 By Rick Wagner:
 1) voz1b1 now has an MPI version, voz1b1_mpi.
    The arguments for the parallel version are
    <pos file> <buffer size> <box size> <prefix> <n div>
    Usage examples are in examples/*mpi.bash
 2) Three Python scripts are added in the bin directory:
      cull_subhalos--remove subhalos (not the particles, just the groups)
      writevtkpoints--write a VTK PolyData file of all particle positions
      writevtkhalos--write VTK PolyData files of all halo particle positions
      (The last two require the Python VTK bindings.)
 3) To reduce their memory footprint, vozinit and voz1b1 now read
    in the position files in chunks. The size is defined in voz.h
    via N_CHUNK.
 4) Made voz1b1 more flexibly handle period boundary conditions, by
    duplicating buffer particles when needed. The maximum buffer size
    is now (1 - 1/ndiv). This is useful for very small (32^3 or less)
    particle counts. 
 5) Made the simulation grid size a command line argument to boz.
 6) Corrected print statement in voztie.c 
 7) Corrected order of argument to fread and fwrite in several places.
 8) Added memory deallocation to voz1b1.c to help parallel version.
 9) Changed boz scale factor in posread to boxsize.

 By Mark Neyrinck:
 1) Reduced the number of command-line arguments in jozov.c.  Now it
    assumes that the output of voz1b1, etc. is blabla.adj and
    blabla.vol; jozov simply takes blabla as an arg.
 2) Changed output format for ZOBOV's jozov.c. Now all three output
    files are in in ASCII format: 
	.txt: list of voids along with data about them
	.zone: particles in each zone
	.void: zones in each void, in order of addition to the void.  Each
		zone-adding event is also now marked with the density contrast
		at which it happens
 3) Included post-processing Python routines (in bin/zobovpostproc.py)
    that implement two strategies for determining edges of large
    voids, described in Sect. 2.5 of arXiv:0712.3049.  These require
    the new .void format.

V 1.2 (Jan 16, 2008):
 By Rick Wagner:
 1) Voboz now accepts the precision settings of Qhull.
 2) Corrected particle indexing in boz.c.*
 3) Moved qhull_a.h into voz.h.
 4) Moved common defines into voz.h.
 5) Fixed first array error in readfiles.c:posread*
 6) Makefile changes, including clean and install targets.
* - these appear to be bugs in v.1.1 or v.1.1.1, but probably not v.1.03.

 By Mark Neyrinck:
 7) voztie.c no longer dies if the volumes measured for a particle differ.
 8) ZOBOV and VOBOZ are now in a single package.

V 1.1.1: (Jan 5, 2008)
 A bug in the not-entirely-essential vozinit program fixed.

V 1.1: (Jan 16, 2007)
 (not well-tested) Many little changes, including decreased memory
waste, and reporting of the most-bound particles. boz.c also tries
unbinding with both the velocity centroid of the core zone of a halo,
and the entire halo.

V 1.03: (Jan 16, 2007)
 In boz.c, fixed another small bug in the kinetic energy
estimation. The bug would slightly affect spread-out but unmassive
small haloes on the edge of a periodic box.

V 1.02: (Dec 31, 2004)
 In boz.c, fixed a bug in the kinetic energy calculation when using
the grid (i.e. for the largest haloes). The kinetic energy had been
somewhat underestimated, in a nonisotropic way.  Also in boz.c, made
the scale factor a into a command-line parameter.

V 1.01: (Feb 22, 2004)
 Fixed a couple of minor bugs, made Omega_matter a command-line
parameter instead of hard-coded.
